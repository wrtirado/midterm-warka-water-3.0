          <br> WW design and development activities have been mainly conducted at the Architecture and Vision labs, in Italy. Since we started with the WW projects we have built several full scale prototypes and conducts several experiments. A number of 12
          prototypes have been constructed to date and WW has been assembled and constructed for test, demonstration, exhibition in several countries such as: Italy, France, Germany, Ethiopia, Brazil and Lebanon.</p>

            We have drafted a business plan for the next 5 years, where each year is divided into 2 semesters and marked by the letter (S). The semesters with the (âœ“) symbol delineate what has been achieved thus far, and the semester with the green mark indicates
            the current phase, which will be achieved with the help of this campaign. We have also planned subsequent phases of work, among which are the launch of 3 field tests and 3 larger pilots, and monitoring test results, before large-scale production.
            <br>
            <br> In 2019, once the project is completed, we plan to start the large-scale production of WW. Moreover, specific training courses will be organized for the inhabitants of the village to construct, use and maintain the WW. We hope to invigorate
            the local economy through manufacturing activities and give children opportunities to invest their time in more productive activities and education. We believe that WW can be a stepping-stone that empowers communities to build greater independence.
