## An Informational Website on the New Company: Warka Water


### The problem

This up-and-coming company has incredible vision. However, despite having a great product, the website used by WW was somewhat lacking. The main issue with the website was mobile optimazation. The site looked decent on a large screen, yet when the it was loaded on a phone screen, photos were shrunk down almost to small to be seen, and text was so large that a single word could take up the entire view width, bumping the next word down to the next line. 

### The solution

For this site, I improved mobile optimazation. I used the bootstrap grid system along with the bootstrap built in classes to make all photos responsive, keep text to a reasonable size, and make the whole site change it's look based on screen size.

In addition, I also implemented UI-View to give the effect of having multiple pages, all of which can be selected by the navbar the top of the page.

I also implemented angular directives such as NG-Click, NG-Show, and NG-Repeat to accomplish tasks as needed on the different pages of the UI-View.
